# Calculator
Calculator was written on Java during completing course from JetBrains.

An artifact is Calculator/out/artifacts/Calculator_jar/Calculator.jar

To use the calculator, you need to type a expression (green text that appears in the upper part of the app after pressing the first (possible) symbol of the expression) and then press "=". If the expression is correct, the black-colored answer will be upper than the written expression. If it is not, then the text of the expression will become red until the user corrects it.
